# A Game of Life Engine

Note that while I work on these projects, they will utilise dynamic SFML, so if you wish to compile the code locally, you will need to [download SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/). Once you have extracted the files from the .zip folder, copy and paste the contents of the folder 'SFML-2.6.1' into a new folder called 'SFML' located at the root of the project directory (in the same folder as the readme/gitignore files). Once I have completed the projects, I hope to update to static SFML so that this step is not necessary, but I will update the readme when/if this happens. Also note that the version of SFML I link to is for Visual C++17, so if you are working in Visual Studio Community, make sure that your standard is set to this if you come across any errors (VS 2019/22 Community unfortunately default to C++14 and not the newer standards). You should now be able to open the .sln files for each of the respective projects (i.e. Pong, Timber, etc) in Visual Studio Community and run the C++ code from there. Note that the build options you will need are 'Win32' (or x86) and 'Debug.' The linker and C++ compiler should be set up appropriately by default due to the .vcxproj file included in this repository, however if Visual Studio Community fails to read this for any reason, you may need to do this manually. I recommend following John Horton's book for this; see the chapter 'Setting up SFML.'
